## 📊 Project Overview

GamePulse is an advanced data science platform that analyzes gaming communities across social media platforms to extract actionable insights about player sentiment, preferences, and behavior patterns. By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques and clustering algorithms, GamePulse transforms raw social data into strategic intelligence that game developers can use to enhance player satisfaction and engagement.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-platform Social Data Collection**: Seamlessly aggregates player discussions from Reddit, Twitter, Discord, and gaming forums
- **Sentiment Analysis Engine**: Identifies positive/negative sentiment with gaming-specific context awareness
- **Topic Extraction & Trending Issues**: Automatically identifies key discussion themes and emerging concerns
- **Player Segmentation**: Creates data-driven player personas based on behavior, preferences, and communication styles
- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracks sentiment shifts over time, especially following game updates or announcements
- **Interactive Visualization Dashboard**: Presents insights through intuitive, shareable visualizations

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **Feature Prioritization**: Identify which game features drive the most positive/negative sentiment
- **Update Impact Analysis**: Measure community reaction to patches, DLCs, and game changes
- **Community Health Monitoring**: Track overall sentiment trends to gauge community satisfaction
- **Competitor Analysis**: Compare player sentiment across competing titles
- **Marketing Effectiveness**: Measure social response to marketing campaigns and announcements

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Data Collection**: PRAW (Reddit API), Tweepy, Discord.py, Selenium
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, PySpark
- **NLP & Embeddings**: HuggingFace Transformers, SentenceBERT, BERTopic
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, UMAP, HDBSCAN
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Dash, NetworkX
- **Database**: MongoDB, Neo4j (for graph relationships)

## 🧠 Clustering Methodology

GamePulse employs a multi-stage clustering approach:

1. **Text Representation**: Generate embeddings for player comments using game-specific fine-tuned BERT models
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply UMAP to reduce embedding dimensions while preserving semantic relationships
3. **Density-Based Clustering**: Utilize HDBSCAN to identify natural player segments without forcing predetermined cluster counts
4. **Cluster Interpretation**: Analyze cluster centroids and extract distinguishing features for each player segment
5. **Validation**: Cross-validate clusters against known player behaviors and gameplay metrics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gamepulse.git
cd gamepulse

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your API keys and preferences
```

### Running the Analysis Pipeline
```bash
# Collect data (defaults to last 7 days)
python collect_data.py --games "Assassin's Creed,Far Cry,Watch Dogs" --days 7

# Process and analyze data
python analyze_sentiment.py --input data/collected_data.json --output results/

# Generate player segments
python cluster_players.py --embeddings results/embeddings.pkl --output results/

# Launch the dashboard
python dashboard.py --port 8050
```
